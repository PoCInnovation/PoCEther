## Quickstart Testnet ‚è©

or if you wants to deploy on local

```
yarn run dev
```

- Start the client :rocket:
```
yarn client
```

You are now ready to access your blockchain security platform !!!

## Deploy new challenge

To be able to deploy a new challenge for the app you are going to need to do a few things

- Add your challenge contract inside contracts/levels and into the subdirectory of your choice depending of the difficulty of the challenge.
- Add factory challenge that will create instances of the challenge based on another factory contract you can find in the contracys/levels directory.
- Add attack contract that will solve the challenge inside contracts/attacks and into the subdirectory of your choice depending of the difficulty of the challenges.
- Add the necessary elements into the client/src/gamedata/levels.json for exemple:
``` json
{
    "name": "BecomeTheNewOwner",
    "description": "The goal of this challenge is to become the owner of the contract.",
    "code": [
        "BecomeTheNewOwner"
    ],
    "value": "0"
},
```
- And the final step is to add the write up of the challenge in markdown type.
